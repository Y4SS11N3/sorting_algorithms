# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Overview
"0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O" is a project within the ALX Software Engineering programme focused on understanding and implementing various sorting algorithms in C programming language. This project aims to delve into the complexity (Big O notation) of different sorting methods, offering hands-on experience with algorithm optimization and efficiency analysis. Through this project, learners will grasp the fundamental concepts of sorting algorithms, compare their performance, and understand their real-world applications.

## Features
- **Implementation of Sorting Algorithms**: Includes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and more, providing a practical approach to algorithm design and optimization.
- **Big O Notation Analysis**: Each sorting algorithm is accompanied by an analysis of its time complexity in the best, average, and worst-case scenarios, fostering a deeper understanding of algorithm efficiency.
- **Doubly Linked List Sorting**: Some sorting algorithms are applied to doubly linked lists, showcasing the versatility of sorting techniques across different data structures.
- **Advanced Sorting Algorithms**: Explores more complex sorting algorithms like Shell Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, and others, broadening the scope of sorting methods.
- **Visualization of Sorting Processes**: Certain tasks may include writing functions to print the array after specific operations, aiding in visualizing the sorting process and understanding the algorithm's step-by-step execution.

## Getting Started
To dive into the sorting algorithms project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Y4SS11N3/sorting_algorithms.git
   ```

## Compilation & Testing
Compile the C files with:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o sort
```
To test the sorting algorithms, you can write your own main C files.

## Examples

### Bubble Sort Example
- **File**: `0-bubble_sort.c`
- **Usage**: Sorts an array of integers in ascending order.

### Insertion Sort Example
- **File**: `1-insertion_sort_list.c`
- **Usage**: Sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order.

### Quick Sort Example
- **File**: `3-quick_sort.c`
- **Usage**: Implements the Lomuto partition scheme to sort an array of integers.

## Big O Notation
Each sorting algorithm includes a file with its Big O notation analysis, helping understand the time complexity in different scenarios.
